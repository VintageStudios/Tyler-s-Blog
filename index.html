    <h1>[Blog #1]: Hello. | 12/19/2025 @ 6:31 PM</h1>
    <p>Hello there, this is my very first blog post, this is how things will look until I'm able to make a better GUI & UI design for the site.</p>
    <p>Anyways, my name is Tyler, the creator of his blog page, this is were i will upload my thoughts, ideas, and more, sadly videos and images wont be uploaded as i'm still getting to know HTML coding.</p>
    <p>But as time goes on, I hope to eventualy be able to upload images and videos, but until then, this is the best i can do.</p>

    <h1>[Blog #2]: I made an update. | 12/19/2025 @ 6:31 PM</h1>
    <p>I think i figured out how to upload and image in a sort of way.</p>
    <p> So I think what i can do is use online images for now, because I'm not sure if i can use custom images (e.g.. myimage.png) unless I use Google Drive for links.</p>

    <h1>[Blog #3]: Update | We now have video for Blogs | 12/20/2025 @ 6:31 PM</h1>
    <p>This video is showing as a 153 Error on mobile devices, and we have no clue why but on PC's it showes just fine.</p>
    <p>I may just scrap the video idea and only use images as it seems better than video.</p>
